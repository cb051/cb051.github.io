        <h4 id="societal-impact-of-ai">Societal Impact of AI</h4>
<p>Since August of 2022, I have been working with the <a href="https://fulbright.uark.edu/departments/world-languages/world-languages-and-digital-humanities-studio.php">Digital Humanities</a> program on
 the societal impact of AI. My involvement with the program is around how environmental factors affect our trust and use of AI.</p>

<p>Digital Humanities (DH) tries to understand the relationship between human factors and emerging technologies. The good people at DH do a wonderful job
pondering what comes next in a world where AI is ubiquitous. Previously, I have given talks on the <em>role bias plays in determining
AI safety</em> and <em>how AI affects our perception of privacy</em>. I am deeply committed to understanding the social and ethical impact that AI has and ways to participate in
progressing healthily forward.</p>

<h4 id="music">Music</h4>
<p>I have played the bass for roughly 13 years. I mostly perform classical and jazz music. I recently started playing with
<a href="https://www.sonamusic.org/">SoNA</a>, a local orchestra. I have also played for the Arkansas Symphony and other ensembles. If you’re ever in the NW Arkansas area you just might see
me performing around town! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3PbnyBuUiGdPdf7zRepJEtJH0Gd2sJSl">Here</a> are some older videos of some of my solo work.</p>

<h4 id="film-photography">Film Photography</h4>
<p>I am a big fan of shooting landscapes and trees. Feel free to check out some of my work on my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/carterbuckner/">Instagram page</a>.
I started after inheriting my grandfather’s old Nikon FE2 and love all of the small movements inherent to the practice. I picked up this practice after I
 became frustrated with continually buying new cameras to meet clarity trends. I loved the imperfections in older photos and especially the ability to produce larger prints
 at a high quality.</p>

<h4 id="art">Art</h4>
<p>I have a love for pen and ink works of flora and fauna. There is nothing more exciting than seeing
 a pretty tree and drawing it. For the past year or so, I have been focusing on watercolors of landscapes. Most of this work is done with walnut ink and a sepia pen (I was inspired by a reproduction I saw once). Nature seems to be a nice balance to my everyday work :).</p>

<p>I hope to share some of them here sometime so check back periodically!</p>
