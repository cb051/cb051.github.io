# Societal Impact of AI
Since August of 2022, I have been working with the [Digital Humanities](https://fulbright.uark.edu/departments/world-languages/world-languages-and-digital-humanities-studio.php) program on
 the societal impact of AI. My involvement with the program is largely around how environmental factors affect how we use AI.

Digital Humanities tries to understand the relationship between human factors and emerging technologies. The good people at DH do a wonderful job
pondering the question of what comes next in a world where AI is ubiquitous. I have given previous talks on the roles that bias play in determining
whether a system is safe and how privacy is affected by AI. I am deeply committed to understanding the social and ethical impact that AI has and ways to participate in
progressing healthily forward.

*# Music
I have played the bass for roughly 13 years. I largely perform classical but also love jazz music. Recently started playing with
[SoNA](https://www.sonamusic.org/), a local orchestra. I have also played for the Arkansas Symphony and other ensembles. If you're ever in the NW Arkansas area you just might see
me performing around town! [Here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3PbnyBuUiGdPdf7zRepJEtJH0Gd2sJSl) are some older videos of some of my solo work.


*# Film Photography
I am a big fan of shooting landscapes and trees. Feel free to check out some of my work on my [Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/carterbuckner/).
I started after inheriting my grandfather's old Nikon FE2 and love all of the small movements inherent to practice. I picked up this practice after I
 became frustating buying cameras to maintain picture quality. I loved the imperfections in older photos and especially the ability to produce larger prints
 at a high quality.


*# Art
I have a love for drawing and can often be found doing pen and ink works of flora and fauna. There is nothing more exciting than seeing
 a pretty tree and drawing it. For the past year or so, I have been focusing on watercolors of landscapes. Most of this work is done using walnut ink and pen (having been
 inspired by a reproduction I saw at a museum once). Nature seems to be a nice balance to my everyday work :).

I hope to share some of them on here sometime so check back periodically!
